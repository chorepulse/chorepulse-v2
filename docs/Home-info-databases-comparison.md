## Critical Warnings

- **ATTOM or CoreLogic** - Enterprise pricing ($12K-$500K+/year) prohibitive for startups
- **Estated for low volumes** - 5,000-call minimum wasteful for \u003c2,000 calls/month

### ⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION:
- **Estated API** - Being migrated to ATTOM, documentation deprecation planned 2026
- **Homesage.ai** - Currently in BETA (though 99.9% uptime claimed)
- **Any API without free tier** - Can't validate data quality before committing

### ✅ SAFE BETS:

- **Homesage.ai** - 30-day free trial, no commitment, unique features

## Technical Integration Notes

### For Google Places API Integration:
All recommended APIs work well alongside Google Places autocomplete:

1. **User types address** → Google Places API autocomplete
2. **User selects address** → Store normalized address
3. **Fetch property details** → RentCast/Homesage/Datafiniti API call
4. **Populate chore tasks** → Use bedrooms/bathrooms count
5. **Improve ad targeting** → Use property value, type, square footage

### Caching Strategy (Reduce Costs):
- Cache property data for 90 days (data doesn't change frequently)
- Only call API once per unique address
- Store: bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, property type in your database
- Refresh on user request or quarterly schedule

### Error Handling:
- Not all addresses return complete data (rural properties, new construction)
- Have fallback: Ask user to manually input bedrooms/bathrooms if API returns incomplete data
- Set reasonable defaults (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms for typical SFH)

---
