## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance Considerations

### Age Collection Laws

#### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - US)
**Applies to**: Children under 13

**What you CAN collect**:
- ✅ First name only (not full name)
- ✅ Age or birthdate (with verifiable parental consent)
- ✅ Username (non-identifiable)
- ✅ Persistent identifiers for internal operations

**What you CANNOT collect without verifiable parental consent**:
- ❌ Full name, address, phone
- ❌ Email address
- ❌ Social security number
- ❌ Photos, videos, audio
- ❌ Geolocation
- ❌ Persistent identifiers for tracking

**How to Comply**:
1. **Neutral Age Screen**: Ask "Are you over 13?" before collecting age
2. **Parental Consent**: For under 13, require parent to verify
3. **Non-Personalized Ads**: Always serve non-personalized ads to under 13
4. **Data Minimization**: Only collect what's necessary

**Recommendation**:
- For KIDS: Ask parent to create account and input child's age
- For TEENS/ADULTS: Can collect birthdate directly
- All ages: Make it optional, incentivize with "personalized experience"

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU)
**Applies to**: All EU residents, any age

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Explicit consent before collecting any personal data (including age)
- ✅ Right to access, delete, and port data
- ✅ Clear privacy policy explaining data use
- ✅ Age of consent: 13-16 (varies by country)

**Implementation**:
```
"We'd like to know your age to personalize your experience.
This information will be used to show you more relevant content.
You can change or delete this information at any time in Settings.
[Agree] [Decline]"
```

#### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act - US)
**Applies to**: California residents

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Disclose what data you collect and why
- ✅ Allow users to opt-out of data sale
- ✅ Provide data deletion on request
- ✅ Under 16: Opt-in required (not opt-out)

**Recommendation**: Use same consent flow as GDPR

### Safe Implementation Strategy

#### For Kid Accounts (Under 13):
1. **Parent Creates Account**: Parent must set up child's profile
2. **Parent Provides Age**: Parent inputs child's birthdate
3. **Parent Controls**: Parent can manage all settings
4. **No Personal Info**: Don't collect child's email, full name, or location
5. **Non-Personalized Ads**: Always serve COPPA-compliant ads

#### For Teen Accounts (13-17):
1. **Optional Birthday Field**: "Help us personalize your experience"
2. **Clear Privacy Notice**: Explain what you'll use age for
3. **Easy Opt-Out**: Can remove age data anytime
4. **Parental Notification**: Notify parent if teen is under family account

#### For Adult Accounts (18+):
1. **Optional Birthday Field**: Same as teens
2. **Marketing Consent**: Separate checkbox for marketing/personalization
3. **Full Data Control**: Access, download, and delete

### Recommended Privacy Policy Updates

Add these sections:

**Age Information**:
```
We may collect your age or birthdate to:
- Personalize your experience
- Show age-appropriate content and ads
- Comply with legal requirements (COPPA, GDPR)

For users under 13, we require verifiable parental consent before
collecting age information. Parents can manage their child's data
at any time in Account Settings.

This information is optional. You can use ChorePulse without
providing your age, though some features may be limited.
```

**Ad Personalization**:
```
We use Google AdSense to display ads on ChorePulse. Age information
may be shared with Google (in anonymized form) to show more relevant
ads. You can opt-out of personalized advertising at any time in
Settings > Privacy.

Users under 13 always receive non-personalized, COPPA-compliant ads
regardless of settings.
```
