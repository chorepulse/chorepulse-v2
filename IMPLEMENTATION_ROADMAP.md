- *Backup Plan:* Caching layer (Redis)

**Risk 3: Scope Creep**
- *Impact:* Miss 4-week deadline
- *Mitigation:* Strict MVP scope, defer non-essential features
- *Backup Plan:* Push Phase 2 features to post-launch

**Risk 4: Deployment Issues**
- *Impact:* Downtime, data loss
- *Mitigation:* Staging environment, rollback plan
- *Backup Plan:* Database backups, previous deployment

---

## Developer Notes

### Time Estimates

These estimates assume:
- 8 hours/day of focused work
- One developer (you)
- Minimal context switching
- No major blockers

**If timeline slips:**
- Days 19-20 have buffer (bug fixes, testing)
- Can reduce polish if needed to hit deadline
- Can deploy with known minor bugs and fix post-launch

### Productivity Tips

1. **Stay focused on MVP scope** - Resist adding features
2. **Test as you build** - Don't save testing for end
3. **Commit frequently** - Small, atomic commits
4. **Document decisions** - Future you will thank you
5. **Take breaks** - Better code when well-rested
6. **Ask for help** - Use AI assistants, Stack Overflow, docs

### Tools to Use

- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion
- **Cursor/Claude** - Architecture questions
- **Supabase Dashboard** - Database queries
- **Vercel Dashboard** - Deployment monitoring
- **Stripe Dashboard** - Payment testing
- **Postman** - API testing

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap is ambitious but achievable. The key is to stay disciplined about scope and focus on shipping a working MVP in 4 weeks.

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good.** Ship v2.0 in 4 weeks, iterate based on user feedback, add features in Phase 2+.

Good luck! 🚀
