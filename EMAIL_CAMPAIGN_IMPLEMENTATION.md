## Automation Setup (Future)

### Option 1: Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)

Create Edge Functions to trigger campaigns based on user events:

**`supabase/functions/trigger-onboarding-emails/index.ts`**
```typescript
// Trigger on user creation
// Schedule follow-up emails using pg_cron or external scheduler
```

**Triggers:**
- User creates organization ‚Üí Send OWNER_WELCOME immediately
- +2 days ‚Üí OWNER_TASK_TIPS
- +5 days ‚Üí OWNER_SCIENCE_UPGRADE
- +8 days ‚Üí OWNER_FAMILY_REPORT
- +11 days ‚Üí OWNER_MOMENTUM
- +14 days ‚Üí OWNER_GRADUATION

**For weekly reports:**
- Use pg_cron: `SELECT cron.schedule('weekly-reports', '0 9 * * 1', 'SELECT trigger_weekly_reports()');`

### Option 2: External Scheduler (Vercel Cron, etc.)

**`app/api/cron/send-emails/route.ts`**
```typescript
// Protected by CRON_SECRET
// Runs daily, checks email_queue and schedules
```

### Option 3: Background Job Processor

Use a service like Inngest, Trigger.dev, or BullMQ to process email queue.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Welcome Email:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/campaigns/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "test-user-id",
    "campaignType": "owner_welcome",
    "customData": {
      "familyName": "Test Family"
    }
  }'
```

2. **Check Development Logs:**
Since `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`, emails are logged to console instead of sent.

3. **Test Template Rendering:**
```typescript
import { renderTemplate } from '@/lib/email-campaigns'
import { EMAIL_TEMPLATES } from '@/lib/email-templates'

const html = renderTemplate(EMAIL_TEMPLATES.OWNER_WELCOME, {
  parentName: 'John',
  familyName: 'Smith Family',
  appUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
})
console.log(html)
```

### Production Testing

1. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in environment
2. Set `EMAIL_FROM` (e.g., `noreply@chorepulse.com`)
3. Send test campaign to your own email
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

---

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local` and production:

```env
# Resend API for sending emails
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx

# From address for emails
EMAIL_FROM="ChorePulse <noreply@chorepulse.com>"

# App URL for links in emails
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://chorepulse.com
```
